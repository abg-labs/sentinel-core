# Sentinel Core

**The Mission-Critical Surveillance Framework.**

Sentinel Core is the open-source foundational layer of the Sentinel platform. It provides the architectural primitives required for high-performance, autonomous video intelligence, object detection, and multi-stream camera management.

This core library is maintained by **AB Group** and is engineered for environments where reliability and low-latency processing are non-negotiable.

## High-Level Architecture

Sentinel Core is designed as a modular pipeline:

1.  **Ingestion**: Multi-protocol stream handling (RTSP, RTMP, Local).
2.  **Detection**: Abstraction layers for AI model inference (YOLO, CLIP, Custom).
3.  **Intelligence**: Data-schema for persistent tracking and spatial awareness.

## Progressive Evolution

Sentinel Core is a living framework. We push technical updates and architectural refinements as they are validated through our ongoing strategic deployments. Our goal is to maintain a continuous stream of progress:

- **Current focus**: Core Schema & AI Abstraction Interfaces.
- **In-development**: High-performance stream acquisition and buffer management logic.
- **Future engineering**: Standardized wrappers for real-time model inference (YOLO/CLIP).

## Philosophy

Surveillance is not just about recording video; it's about **autonomous situational awareness.** Sentinel Core provides the schemas that transform raw pixels into strategic data.
