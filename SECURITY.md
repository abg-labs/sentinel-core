# Security Policy - Sentinel Core

## Operational Security (OPSEC)

As a framework engineered for mission-critical surveillance, security is our primary directive.

1.  **Air-Gapped Compatibility**: Sentinel Core is designed to operate without external network dependencies once models are loaded.
2.  **Zero-Telemetry**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any surveillance data outside of your controlled environment.
3.  **Vulnerability Reporting**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact the AB Group Strategic Security team directly at [security@abgroupglobal.com].

## Institutional Vetting

Sentinel Core undergoes regular architectural reviews to ensure compliance with sovereign security standards.
